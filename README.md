# Disclaimer
Yes, this tool is specifically for permuting over a specified term. This is very similar to password generation. **However, you should not abuse this software. Do not use this software to break the law, including (but not limited to) hacking and breaking into systems without prior authorization to do so.**

This set of tools is for **educational** and **constructive** purposes only. This means that if you are a student of cryptography or cryptology and wanted to study tools and maybe complete a lab using these tools - you are more than welcome to do so (provided your lab allows you to use 3rd party tools). Likewise, if you are a cryptographer or cryptologist trying to assess the ability to break into a system - you are more than welcome to use this tool.

If you are planning to use this tool for other purposes (e.g. using this tool to pipe all of these permutations into an SSH session to try to crack a password), that is not permitted, and you are subject to any laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for how you use this tool. With great power comes great responsibility.
